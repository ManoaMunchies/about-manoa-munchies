## Overview

Aloha Eats is a web application that allows users to login and view all of the different food options on campus. You can see what is currently available on that day to eat, as well as filter out specific food options based on your preferences. Aloha Eats also allows vendors to login and upload relevant information to raise awareness for their business.

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation

Second, visit the [Aloha Eats application github page](https://github.com/ManoaMunchies/manoa-munchies), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo.  However you do it, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the manoa-munchies/app directory and install libraries with:

```
