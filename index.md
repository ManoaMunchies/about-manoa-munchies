## Overview

Aloha Eats is a web application that allows users to login and view all of the different food options on campus. You can see what is currently available on that day to eat, as well as filter out specific food options based on your preferences. Aloha Eats also allows vendors to login and upload relevant information to raise awareness for their business.
